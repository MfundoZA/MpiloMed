# Mpilo-Med

## Description

Mpilo-Med is a system built to bring access to healthcare to all South Africans with cutting-edge technology that will allow our users to save time and money when seeking medical attention.

## How does it work?

Mpilo-Med comes with multiple innovative features that revolutionize healthcare such as:
  * The ability to indicate to users clinics that are overcapacity so that they can chose another clinic that will not turn them away due to wokers not being available.
  * The ability to list the medicine a clinic has so that users know wheter they will be able to get their medicine at a paticular clinic.
  * The ability to have users' chronic medicine delivered to them on a repeating (weekly, monthly etc.) basis.
  
As well as features that can help our users stay organized such as:
 * Appointment scheduling and reminders
 * Reminders to take their medication
